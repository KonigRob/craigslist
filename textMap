So, super simple text file for now.  Just to get ideas and stucture down.
I'll be using a simple cascading style to organize how pages will be linked.  In terms of who the parent will be.
There is two ways we could do this.  We could actually replicate the real site, as the actual home page is a map, 
and you select where you are. (https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites)
OR, we just replicate the site, as if we've already picked our location.  Which is what I'll be showing below.
